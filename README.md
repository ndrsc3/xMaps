# xMaps
*XRPL enabled Map Application*

---

## **[BACKGROUND]**
Maps are a fundamental utility in orienting oneself in the ever-growing world around them. Throughout history, pioneers took the risk to explore and map unchartered terrain. It was these maps that laid the framework for communities to grow. Now, a nearly infinite number of maps can be carried in your pocket. Each of which tailored to unique communities, businesses, activities, or interests. As a result, the amount of public GIS data accessible through APIs is massive. It is now a task to not only organize the data to fit needs of the users, but to capture the value generated by the users and funnel it into the community.

With xMaps we can build modern day maps that bridge open-source GIS datasets and frameworks with blockchain via the XRPL enabling the user to create, share, explore the bridge between the digital and physical worlds. A new class of digital assets can unlock entirely new functionality as we interact with both the digital and physical worlds. 

## **[REQUIREMENTS]**
*The xMaps app shall contain*
- XRP wallet integration into xMaps with [Xumm Accounts](https://xumm.app/)
- Incorporate Stream Protocol via ILP to enable streaming payments from Users
- Define new GIS Data structures adding additional properties tied to the XRPL
    - Investigation into what fields to add
        - Wallet IDs (Individual or Cluster)
        - NFT Tokens (Ruins)
        - UserID (Is this different than WalletID)
        - GroupID (Access Permissions)
        - Transaction History
- Query XRPL database for all validators and gateways and store in database.
    - Investigation on what additional information could be relevantly displayed
- Implement SQL Database to store GIS Data
    - User Generated
    - XRPL Generated
- Reference open-source databases of GIS data ISO/TC 211
    - OpenStreetMap Foundation @ varying resolution
        - What Data? Enough to frame maps of the world. 
        - Streets
        - City Names

## **[RECOMMENDATIONS]**
